# CloudMicrophysics.jl

The CloudMicrophysics.jl is a library of bulk microphysics schemes.
So far it includes
  a 0-moment scheme that instantly removes the precipitable cloud condensate,
  a simple 1-moment scheme,
  a collection of different 2-moment autoconversion and accretion functions,
  and an aerosol activation scheme.
