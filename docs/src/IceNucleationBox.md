# 0-dimensional adiabatic parcel model

The model solves for saturation ratio in a 0-dimensional
  adiabatic parcel raising with constant velocity.
It is based on [KorolevMazin2003](@cite), as well as the cirrus box model
  [Karcher2006](@cite), [Tully2023](@cite) and
  is meant as a sandbox for testing different nucleation schemes.

We define liquid saturation ratio ``S_l``
```math
\begin{equation}
S_l = \frac{e}{e_{sl}}
\end{equation}
```
where:
- ``e`` - is the partial pressure of water vapor,
- ``e_{sl}`` - is the partial pressure of water vapor at saturation over liquid water.
Note that some models, for example [KorolevMazin2003](@cite), denote ``S_l``
  to be supersaturation ``\frac{e}{e_{sl}} - 1``.

The change in saturation ratio can be described as
```math
\begin{equation}
\frac{dS_l}{dt} = \frac{1}{e_{sl}} \frac{de}{dt} - \frac{e}{e_{sl}^2} \frac{de_{sl}}{dt}
\end{equation}
```
From ideal gas law the partial pressure of water vapor can be written as
```math
\begin{equation}
e = q_v p \frac{R_v}{R_a}
\end{equation}
```
where:
- ``q_v`` is the water vapor specific humidity
- ``p`` is the air pressure
- ``R_v``, ``R_a`` are the gas constants for water vapor and air.

The change in partial pressure can be written as
```math
\begin{equation}
\frac{de}{dt} = \frac{dq_v}{dt} p \frac{R_v}{R_a} + q_v \frac{dp}{dt}\frac{R_v}{R_a}
\end{equation}
```

From the Clausiusâ€“Clapeyron relation
```math
\begin{equation}
\frac{de_{sl}}{dt} = \frac{L_v e_{sl}}{R_v T^2} \frac{dT}{dt}
\end{equation}
```
where:
- ``L_v`` is the latent heat of vaporization,
- ``T`` is the temperature.

From the moist adiabatic assumption
```math
\begin{equation}
\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{R_a T}{c_p p} \frac{dp}{dt} + \frac{L_v}{c_p} \frac{dq_l}{dt} + \frac{L_s}{c_p} \frac{d q_i}{dt}
\end{equation}
```
where:
- ``q_l`` is the cloud liquid water specific humidity,
- ``q_i`` is the cloud ice specific humidity,
- ``L_s`` is the latent heat of sublimation.

From hydrostatic balance and assuming constant vertical velocity:
```math
\begin{equation}
\frac{dp}{dt} = -\frac{p g}{R_a T} w
\end{equation}
```
where:
- ``g`` is the gravitational acceleration
- ``w`` is the constant vertical velocity.

Accounting for conservation of water, i.e. ``\frac{dq_v}{dt} + \frac{dq_l}{dt} + \frac{dq_i}{dt} = 0``,
and rearranging the terms
```math
\begin{equation}
\frac{dS_l}{dt} = a_1 w S_l - \left(a_2 + a_3 \right) S_l \frac{dq_l}{dt} - \left(a_2 + a_4\right) S_l \frac{dq_i}{dt}
\end{equation}
```
where:
```math
\begin{equation}
a_1 = \frac{L_v g}{c_p T^2 R_v} - \frac{g}{R_a T}
\end{equation}
```
```math
\begin{equation}
a_2 = \frac{1}{q_v}
\end{equation}
```
```math
\begin{equation}
a_3 = \frac{L_v^2}{R_v T^2 c_p}
\end{equation}
```
```math
\begin{equation}
a_4 = \frac{L_v L_s}{R_v T^2 c_p}
\end{equation}
```

Saturation ratio over ice can then be related to ``S_l`` by the relation
```math
\begin{equation}
  S_i = \xi S_l
  \label{eq:supersat_relation}
\end{equation}
```
where ``\xi = \frac{e_{sl}}{e_{si}}`` is the ratio of saturation vapor pressure over liquid and saturation vapor pressure over ice.

The crux of the problem is modeling the ``\frac{dq_l}{dt}`` and ``\frac{dq_i}{dt}``
  for different homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation paths.

## Condensation on a monodisperse droplet population

The diffusional growth of individual cloud droplet is described by
([see discussion](https://clima.github.io/CloudMicrophysics.jl/previews/PR103/Microphysics1M/#Snow-autoconversion)),
```math
\begin{equation}
  r_l \frac{dr_l}{dt} = \frac{1}{\rho_l} \, (S_l - 1) \, G_l(T)
\end{equation}
```
where:
- ``r_l`` is the droplet radius
- ``\rho_l`` is the water density
- ``G_l(T) = \left(\frac{L_v}{KT} \left(\frac{L_v}{R_v T} - 1 \right) + \frac{R_v T}{e_{sl} D} \right)^{-1}``
    combines the effects of thermal conductivity and water diffusivity,
- ``K`` is the thermal conductivity of air,
- ``D`` is the diffusivity of water vapor.

!!! note
    Some formulations don't consider the ``-1`` term in the denominator of G(T)

Assuming spherical water droplets, the change in droplet mass ``m_l`` can be described as
```math
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dm_l}{dt} = 4 \pi \rho_l r^2 \frac{dr_l}{dt} = 4 \pi r_l (S_l - 1) G_l(T)
\end{equation}
```

Then, for a monodisperse distribution of droplets ``n(r) = N_{tot} \delta(r-r_0)``
```math
\begin{equation}
   \frac{dq_l}{dt} = \frac{1}{V} \frac{1}{\rho_a} 4 \pi (S_l - 1) G_l(T) \int_{0}^{\infty} n(r) r dr =
                                 \frac{1}{\rho_a} 4 \pi (S_l - 1) G_l(T) N_{tot} r_0
\end{equation}
```
where:
- ``N_{tot}`` is the total number concentration of droplets per volume of air ``V``
- ``r_0`` is their radius.

## Water vapour deposition on dust

Similarly, for a case of a spherical ice particle growing through water vapor deposition
```math
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dm_i}{dt} = 4 \pi \, r_i \, \alpha_m \, (S_i - 1) \, G_i(T)
  \label{eq:massratesphere}
\end{equation}
```
where:
 - ``r_i`` is the ice particle radius,
 - ``\alpha_m`` is the accommodation coefficient that takes into account the fact that not all water vapor molecules
     that arrive at the particle surface will join the growing crystal,
 - ``G_i(T) = \left(\frac{L_s}{KT} \left(\frac{L_s}{R_v T} - 1 \right) + \frac{R_v T}{e_{si} D} \right)^{-1}``
     combines the effects of thermal conductivity and water diffusivity,
 - ``K`` is the thermal conductivity of air,
 - ``D`` is the diffusivity of water vapor.

!!! note
    The ``r_i`` in eq. (\ref{eq:massratesphere})
    should be replaced by the capacitance ``C``,
    when considering non-spherical particles.
    For a sphere ``C=r``, for a circular disc ``C=2r/\pi``.

The rate of change of ice specific humidity ``q_i`` can be computed as
```math
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d \, q_i}{dt} =
  \frac{1}{V} \frac{1}{\rho_a} \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{dm_i}{dt} n(r) dr
  \label{eq:qi_rat}
\end{equation}
```

Assuming that the size distribution of nucleated and growing ice crystals is a delta function
(i.e. in a monodisperse population of ice crystals) ``n(r) = N_{act} \delta(r-r_0)``
eq. (\ref{eq:qi_rat}) can be written as
```math
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d \, q_i}{dt} =
  \frac{1}{\rho} N_{act} \alpha_m 4 \pi \, r_0 \, (S_i - 1) \, G_i(T)
\end{equation}
```
where ``N_{act}`` is the number of activated ice particles and ``r_0`` is their radius.

``N_{act}`` can be computed for example from
  [activated fraction](https://clima.github.io/CloudMicrophysics.jl/previews/PR103/IceNucleation/#Activated-fraction-for-deposition-freezing-on-dust) ``f_i``
```math
\begin{equation}
  N_{act} = N_{tot} f_i
\end{equation}
```

## Example figures

Here we show example simulation results from the adiabatic parcel
  model with deposition freezing on dust.
The model is run three times for 30 minutes simulation time,
  (shown by three different colors on the plot).
Between each run the water vapor specific humidity is changed,
  while keeping all other state variables the same as at the last time step
  of the previous run.
The prescribed vertical velocity is equal to 3.5 cm/s.

The parcel can also run a liquid-only option. In the plots below, the model
  ran with only condensation (no ice or freezing). It is compared to
  [Rogers1975](@cite) figure 1 in yellow.
